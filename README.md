# Smart Contract Management - ETH + AVAX

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for managing custom tokens on both Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX) blockchains. The main contracts include a custom ERC-20 token contract and a contract for handling basic smart contract functionality.

## Contracts

### 1. CustomToken.sol

The `CustomToken` contract is an ERC-20 token with additional features. It includes functions for minting, transferring tokens, and burning tokens. The token can be deployed on both Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains.

### 2. SmartContractFunctionality.sol

The `SmartContractFunctionality` contract provides basic smart contract functionalities, including error handling with `require`, `assert`, and `revert`. It demonstrates the use of these functions for handling various scenarios in a smart contract.
